            I really enjoy being part of a team and together make things work, I believe that sharing knowledge it's a key on overcoming challenges
            .I have had the opportunity to share the passion for coding as a Professor, in my University creating interest over three generations of students on how fulfilling programming 
            and how valuable is this skill in plenty on contexts allowing us to modify our environment.I have had the chance to be leader of two startups where I learned how important it's the leadership on making things work and how to overcome most of the challenges and planning far 
            ahead to overcome any possibility of what decisions are taken to.
